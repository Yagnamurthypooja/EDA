Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project
Project Title: Richest Individuals Analysis
Description:
Conducted a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project focusing on analyzing the wealth distribution and characteristics of the world's richest individuals. Utilized Python programming and data manipulation libraries, including Pandas and NumPy, for efficient data processing and analysis. Employed data visualization tools, such as Matplotlib, to create insightful visualizations, including bar charts and pie charts, illustrating the distribution of wealth across industries, countries, and top individuals.
Key Achievements:
Data Cleaning and Processing: Implemented data cleaning techniques to handle missing values, remove unnecessary columns, and format data for analysis.
Feature Engineering: Developed a function to convert currency representations into a standardized numeric format, facilitating quantitative analysis of net worth.
Visualization: Created visually appealing and informative plots, such as bar charts and pie charts, to effectively communicate insights about the distribution of wealth among different countries and industries.
Country-wise Analysis: Conducted a detailed analysis of the distribution of wealth among the top 10 countries, visualizing the findings through a pie chart with an exploded effect.
Industry-wise Analysis: Investigated the distribution of wealth across various industries within the dataset, presenting the results in a horizontal bar chart.
Custom Styling: Applied a specific Matplotlib style ("fivethirtyeight") for a modern and clean visual presentation.
Tools and Technologies Used: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib
This project showcases my proficiency in data analysis, data visualization, and programming skills, providing valuable insights into the wealth distribution landscape of the dataset.
